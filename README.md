# CMU 11-785 Deep Learning Spring 2019 (Bhiksha Raj)

CMU 11-785 Deep Learning Spring 2019 (Bhiksha Raj)

A fully organised, integrity checked repo containing all lecture materials available at
the following coursepage:

http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/user/bhiksha/WWW/courses/deeplearning/Fall.2018/www/

The main lecture videos that accompany the contents of this repo are available at*:

And the recitation videos are available at*:

https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLp-0K3kfddPwYiPKQqMWgYjpFmkW2ifr7

By folder, the repo contains:

1) cmu-11-785-deep-learning-course-page.html - an archived, complete html document that contains
the course schedule, in case the link is no longer hosted by CMU.

2) cmu-11-785-deep-learning-course-page_files - the relevant files to appropriately display the above
html document.

3) homework-assignments - contains the 5 full homework assignments*.

4) lecture-slides - contains all pdf lecture slides*. 

5) projects - for completeness, contains project proposal guidance for the course.

6) recitations - contains all pdf recitation slides, data, python scripts and Jupyter notebooks*.

Remarks:

* course video links - these have not been thoroughly audited and checked, but a cursory glance suggests that
the main lecture video Youtube playlist is fairly complete and consistent with the course page. Similarly
for the recitation lecture video Youtube playlist. Only mild caveat regarding
completeness is that there was some unfamiliar Jupyter notebooks/script content being displayed on screen in some of the later videos. 

* homework-assignments - contains a "spring-2019-incomplete" and "spring-2020-complete" folder. 

The "spring-2019-incomplete" folder shows that a substantial proportion of homework assignments from the Spring 2019 coursepage
is missing. In the interests of completeness; of serving as a reminder that this is the case; and in order to avoid
having to do janitorial/detective work if I ever go over this material at a later date, it has been included.

The only homework-assignment materials available from the Spring 2019 coursepage are:

HW0 - html link
HW1-part1 - html link - "An Introduction to Neural Networks - Neural Networks"
HW1-part2 - html link - "An Introduction to Neural Networks - Frame Level Classification Speech"
HW2-part1 - pdf handout - "An Introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks."
HW2-part2 - pdf handout - "Face Verification via Convolutional Neural Networks"

and all Kaggle links are active.

All the remaining links are broken.

The "spring-2020-complete" folder contains all homework assignments downloaded from the Spring 2020 iteration of
the course. There seem to be broad similarities between the Spring 2019 assignments and Spring 2020 assignments
on the basis of title alone. It is being assumed that the later iteration homework assignments can adequately
and faithfully serve as a substitute for the Spring 2019 assignments. 

In order to stand by the substitution with a higher degree of confidence, the Spring 2019 live Kaggle links content need to
be scrutinised and checked against the content in the Spring 2020 assignments data - pending.

*lecture-slides - all pdfs checked and consistent with coursepage, except:

Lecture 24 - Variational Autoencoders - a duplicate reinforcement learning lecture was uploaded
on the coursepage for download, titled "lecture-24-rl-pt1-15apr". 

There may be an appropriate substitute in the Spring 2020 iteration of the course.

* recitations

This was tricky to piece together.

The coursepage provided all the PDF handouts for Recitation 0 to Recitation 12 (none for Recitation 13)
and these have been saved into the corresponding numbered recitations subfolders.

However, these materials are no longer available for download from the coursepage, as all
the links are broken.

There rest of the materials i.e. data, python scripts and Jupyter notebooks for Recitation 0 to
Recitation 10 were downloaded from:

https://github.com/cmudeeplearning11785/Spring2019_Tutorials

and are stored in the corresponding numbered recitations subfolders.

The above CMU GitHub repo does not contain any of the PDF Handouts that were originally downloaded
from the CMU coursepage.

From Recitation 11 to Recitation 12, there does not seem to be any associated content
in the form of data, python scripts, nor Jupyter notebooks, and hence the corresponding
numbered recitations subfolders contain only lone PDFs.

Recitation 13 on Reinforcement Learning, referred to as Recitation 12 on the YouTube playlist,
has no accompanying PDF download. Perhaps a substitute can be found from the Spring 2020 iteration?

* readings - not included due to space considerations. May upload in the future, or provide a linked list.
